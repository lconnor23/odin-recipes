        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Naan - easy naan bread recipe using a cast-iron skillet. Soft, puffy, with beautiful brown blisters just like Indian restaurants. This is the best recipe you'll find online!</p>
        <p>My naan recipe is made on a stove top, using a very hot cast-iron skillet.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1/4 oz active dry yeast</li>
                <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
                <li>oil for greasing the skillet</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, add the sugar, warm water, and yeast together.
                     Stir to combine well. The yeast should be activated when it becomes
                    foamy, about 10 minutes. Transfer the flour to a flat surface and make
                    a well in the middle. Add the yeast mixture, yoghurt, salt and oil, 
                    knead the dough until the surface becomes smooth and shiny, about 10 
                    minutes. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm 
                    place (for example: beside the stovetop or warm oven). The dough should 
                    double in size, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll the dough to a 8‚Äù circle 
                    using a rolling spin.</li>
                <li>Heat up a skillet (cast-iron preferred) over high heat and lightly grease 
                    the surface with some oil to avoid the dough from sticking to the skillet. 
                    Place the dough on the skillet. When it puffs up and bubbles and burnt 
                    spots appear, flip it over and cook the other side. Repeat the same until 
                    all dough are done.</li>
                <li>Brush the naan with the melted butter, serve warm.</li>
            </ol>
